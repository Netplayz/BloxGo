Hi im Net!

I have a dream of making BloxGo for a while now and since I found ERMs source code its basically just a 1:1 expect some rebranding and hopefully higher up time since ERM
has been very glitchy recently. If you have any issues please email me at Netplayz@programmer.net. Credts to the ERM developers since they are awesoome for allowing someone like me to make my dream come to true to make BloxGO.
I just wouldnt have the time to make such a huge project.

Thank you,
Net
